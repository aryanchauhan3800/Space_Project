    <h4>Earth formed about 4.5 billion years ago from gas and dust left over from the formation of the Sun. It's the only known planet to support life due to its water, atmosphere, and climate. The planet's atmosphere protects us from harmful solar radiation, while its magnetic field shields the surface from space weather. Continents move slowly over time due to plate tectonics, reshaping the land. Earthâ€™s orbit and axial tilt also create the changing seasons we experience annually.</h4>

    <h4>Yellow stars, like our Sun, are categorized as G-type stars. They form from massive clouds of gas and dust, igniting nuclear fusion in their cores to produce energy. These stars have stable temperatures and can live for about 10 billion years. The Sun, Earth's primary energy source, has been burning for 4.6 billion years and is essential for sustaining life on our planet.</h4>

    <h4>Black holes are regions in space with such strong gravity that not even light can escape them. They form when massive stars collapse at the end of their life cycle. Black holes can vary in size, from small to supermassive, often found at the centers of galaxies. Despite their reputation for destruction, black holes play a key role in shaping galaxies and influencing cosmic evolution.</h4>
